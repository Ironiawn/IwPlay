# IwPlay

Yaaay!

Another project that was created to be a clone of GOG Galaxy/EGS/Steam/Origin and so on..

Made in C# and the server-side code in PHP
REST API made in JSON and/or other XML callbacks

Uses "anti-VM" rules to avoid cheating (really?)
Sorry, I'm still learning how to create a good read-me, and how to use Github :(
Also: I'm still learning C# and PHP folks!

- There's an exe using Crypto Obfuscator (I've lost the project of it too)

Bye :P

ps: unfinished and outdated project
ps2 (not the playstation): I'll try to create new open source projects and make a repo with all the source code (including an Android app hehe - Have an iOS but don't know how to use the OS and how to create apps for it)

Happy coding!
